WIP

I have recently picked up mountain biking and have never had such clear goals as when I am at the top of a trail; Get to the bottom safely, it would also be nice if I am the fastest. When I compare this to something like setting career goals, I wish for that same level of clarity. I have spent some time improving my interactions with goals and I wanted to share some of my observations and hopefully some insight that can help others with understanding goals.


**Observation 1 :**
A goal is a feeling about a change in the state. We believe that if that thing were to change to the state we desire we would then derive some result that would produce a positive feeling. 

**Observation 2 :**
All goals are a problem we want to overcome. We want something to change and we must overcome some problems in order for that change to become reality. 

**Observation 3 :**
Desired states require some change in action by someone and people are generally not good at connecting actions to desired states.

**Observation 4 :**
The state of change can originate externally or internally and how we interact with the goal will depend greatly on where it originates. 

**Observation 5 :**
There is a structure to goals and most people will place a goal as one spot in the structure. 

  The structure 
  
* Values : A feeling we hold strong that motivates actions. Q: Is this a feeling that I hold?
  * The Change : An end state we want to reach. Q: Does the statement have an end state?
    * Requirements : Something we need to reach a desired result. Q: Does this support something larger?
      * Methods : What we will do to reach a desired result or requirement. Q: Is this an action? 
        * Habits : Things that will support the methods and make sure they get done. Q: Does this support an action?
